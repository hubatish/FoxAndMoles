Run any of the Demo builds, but please copy to your own computer first.
It's networked, so find another person (or two) and have one person click Create Server and the others Join Server.  
Only click Ready when everyone who's going to Join has joined.  Be patient; it might be kind of slow connecting.
Once you're on the actual game screen, you can control your character either with the mouse or arrow keys (depending on if you're the fox or a mole, respectively). Apologies that it's a bit difficult to figure out which character you are, but you should be able to tell by the indicator when you take an action.
Once you're action is ready, press space.  When everyone presses space, your action will execute.
Good luck eating moles and worms!
