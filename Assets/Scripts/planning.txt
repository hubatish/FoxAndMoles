Structure
Main Menu
One player presses Create Server
Everyone else pressses Join Server
When on the next screen it says Number of Players and Start
Each player that presses Start sends out an RPC call which +1's to numPlayersReady
when server gets this, it checks if numPlayersReady == numPlayers
if so, sends out an rpc call that loads the next level
Each player needs to instantiate their own player I think (so network.isMine works)
Each player should have a number (ie, they are network # 0,1,2,3)
Server can send out a list with everyones roles and positions
Then each person instantiates an object at that position, sends the instantiate msg back
everyone has each player!

Turn
Each player presses a button/does an action.  Game records it for later (probably with function pointer).
When do action, send message to server saying are ready and with action taken.  
When server gets msg from all players, send out all actions queued.
Each player (&server) executes all actions and each character moves to new position.
Each player detects own collisions and increments score.
only the server can start a new round though.
